# To Do #
- [ ] Allow user to specify file as last argument
- [ ] Write man page
- [ ] Performance test with very large data files (memory usage and execution time)
- [ ] Create homebrew and aptitude packages
- [ ] Add an --unescape option that replaces the delimiter with an unused character and removes all escaping (putting newlines on one line?) in order to use the file with standard bash tools
- [ ] Add a validation option to validate *sv files
- [ ] Allow use of first row as header row to choose which fields to print
